# G1ANT-linkedin
Linkedin Addon for G1ANT Studio

# How to use:

## `login` command 

1. This command logs the user into the LinkedIn site. This command should be called first before any of the other commands can be used. 
2. This command takes two arguments: `email` and `pword`, `email` stores the ID used to login into linkedin, `pword` stores the password to be used to login. An additional parameter `search` is required by Selenium but any value can be given to it, the value gets replaced in code.
